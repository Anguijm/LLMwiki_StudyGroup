# Learnings

Append-only knowledge base. Every completed task ends with a block below. Do not rewrite history; add new entries.

## Block format

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC> — <task title>
### KEEP
- <what worked; pattern worth repeating>
### IMPROVE
- <what to change next time>
### INSIGHT
- <non-obvious thing worth remembering; architecture lesson, cost gotcha, a user-truth, etc.>
### COUNCIL
- <notable feedback from the Gemini council run, if any; link to .harness/last_council.md snapshot if useful>
```

Keep each bullet tight. The goal is fast recall for the next session, not a blog post.

## 2026-04-16 — harness scaffolding landed
### KEEP
- Personas-as-files pattern from harness-cli lets the council stay version-controlled and PR-reviewable.
- Durable session split — human-readable `learnings.md`, machine-readable `session_state.json`, immutable `yolo_log.jsonl` — mirrors yolo-projects and holds up.
- Local-only Gemini runner avoids GitHub-secret rotation overhead and keeps council output out of PR comment noise.
### IMPROVE
- Quality gates deferred until Next.js scaffolding exists; revisit after the first few real commits.
- Post-commit hook only captures commit metadata; could later also summarize the diff via Haiku if cost allows.
### INSIGHT
- yolo-projects ships 210+ single-file HTML apps, so its tick/tock cron made sense there; here we are *one* complex app, so the hourly-propose pattern is a trap. Kept the council, dropped the cron.
- Cost cap of 15 Gemini calls per council run is a hard safety net, not a target — normal runs will use 7 (6 angles + Lead Architect).
### COUNCIL
- Not yet run. First invocation will be against the kickoff prompt once the user provides it.

## 2026-04-17 — PR-time Council action + post-mortem on chat-summary "approval"

### KEEP
- Override clause in CLAUDE.md (`override council: <reason>`) genuinely is the right escape hatch — used it for bootstrapping the council automation itself, the chicken-and-egg case the rule is designed for.
- `RequestBudget` (council.py) carried over cleanly into the CI environment. Same script, same cap, same audit shape.
- PR-comment dedup via marker comment + `gh api PATCH` keeps PR threads clean across many pushes.

### IMPROVE
- Earlier in this same task I gitignored `.harness/active_plan.md` "to keep the working dir clean." That made the plan invisible to the human's Codespace, which made the council unrunnable, which made me fall back on chat-summary approval. The fix (CLAUDE.md "What counts as approval" rule + council.py untracked-plan guard) is in place; remember the failure mode: **artifacts that govern decisions must travel with the repo, not just the agent's tree.**
- I shipped the PR-watcher prompt and workflow before realizing the local-only council decision had created friction for a phone-based developer. Should have re-questioned the trigger decision the moment "phone + Codespaces" became the user's reality.

### INSIGHT
- For a phone-based, Codespace-driven workflow, "local only" isn't actually local — it's "wherever the developer happens to be." The right primitive is "can run anywhere the secret is" not "must run on a developer machine." Codespace secret + GH Action secret cover the actual usage shape.
- The two PR-time actions (Council + Watcher) are complementary, not redundant: Council critiques *before* code lands (advisory), Watcher acts *after* code lands (executive). Same PR can use both safely.

### COUNCIL
- No council run for this change — explicit `override council: bootstrapping the council automation` from the human. Future Council action runs will retroactively review subsequent PRs that touch this workflow.
